    # note: inside e2e container, the network allows accessing
    # "web" host under name "web"
    # so "curl http://web" would return whatever the webserver
    # in the "web" container is cooking
    # see https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/

    command: npx cypress run
    # mount the host directory e2e/cypress and the file e2e/cypress.config.js as
    # volumes within the container
    # this means that:
    #  1. anything that Cypress writes to these folders (e.g., screenshots,
    #     videos) appears also on the Docker host's filesystem
    #  2. any change that the developer applies to Cypress files on the host
    #     machine immediately takes effect within the e2e container (no docker
    #     rebuild required).
